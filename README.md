# Web3 Basics – Hands-on Blockchain and DApp Exploration

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a practical understanding of blockchain fundamentals, Web3 concepts, and decentralized applications (DApps).  
It focuses on setting up a MetaMask wallet, interacting with the Sepolia Ethereum test network, and completing a token swap using the Uniswap testnet DApp.  
The goal is to develop hands-on experience with decentralized systems in a risk-free environment.

---

## Objectives
- Understand blockchain architecture and distributed ledger technology.  
- Learn consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).  
- Configure and secure a MetaMask wallet for testnet use.  
- Obtain test ETH from the Sepolia faucet.  
- Perform a token swap on the Uniswap testnet DApp.  
- Verify transactions using the Sepolia Etherscan block explorer.

## MetaMask Setup
MetaMask was installed as a browser extension and configured for the Sepolia Test Network.  
A new wallet was created, and the secret recovery phrase was stored securely offline.  
This wallet was used to interact with decentralized applications on the testnet.

---

## Obtaining Testnet ETH
Test ETH was requested from the Alchemy Sepolia Faucet using the wallet’s public address.  
The transaction was confirmed on the Sepolia Etherscan explorer, showing successful crediting of test ETH to the wallet.

---

## DApp Interaction
The Uniswap DApp (testnet version) was used to perform a token swap between testnet ETH and testnet DAI.  
MetaMask was connected for transaction authorization, and the swap was confirmed and verified on Sepolia Etherscan.  
This exercise demonstrated the use of smart contracts to execute trustless and transparent transactions.

---

## Transaction Verification
All on-chain activity was verified using Sepolia Etherscan.  
Transaction details such as sender, recipient, gas fee, and confirmation status were reviewed for accuracy and transparency.

---

## Reflection
This exercise provided practical exposure to decentralized technologies and enhanced understanding of how blockchain networks operate.  
It reinforced the importance of wallet security, transaction verification, and the role of smart contracts in automating decentralized logic.  
Overall, the experience improved confidence in using Web3 tools and interacting safely with DApps.
